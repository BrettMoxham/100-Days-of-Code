# 100-Days-of-Code
Work for my 100 Days of Code Challenge
Started: July 8th 2020

Day 1: Started work on building out a race chart for cumulative HR from the Batters dataset from Sean Lahman. Code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/BrettMoxham/100-Days-of-Code/blob/master/07%2008%202020%20-%20HR%20Race.Rmd)

Day 2: Continued work on the race chart. Kept wracking my head trying to figure out why my basic graph wasn't annimating correctly. Realised that the players were not carried all the way through all potential years. Will have to adjust data set to fix this. 

Day 3: Worked on the player/yearID issue that had me stumped. Pretty sure i got it figured out. Learned a lot in terms of merging and joining. As well as dealing with NA's. Hoping to have the final graph out tomorrow!

Day 4: Spent more time on the building the gif. Failed miserably ![see here](https://github.com/BrettMoxham/100-Days-of-Code/blob/master/HR_total_failed.gif) Still going to power through! Going to attempt to follow the code from Jon Harmon - https://github.com/jonthegeek/tidytuesday/blob/master/jon/2019-36/code.R.

Day 5: Built out the final gif in the current project. Really happy with how it turned out. Learned a lot, ready to move on to the next project.

Day 6: Worked on building out a [custom theme](https://github.com/BrettMoxham/100-Days-of-Code/blob/master/07%2013%202020%20-%20Custom%20Theme.Rmd) for my plots moving forward. Going to look at building out a personal library so i have quick access to it. 

Day 7: Learned about developing a personal library. Put my custom theme in so I can use it going forward. Followed the tutorial from [Fong Chun Chan](https://tinyheero.github.io/jekyll/update/2015/07/26/making-your-first-R-package.html). Good first week! Ready for the next challenge.

Day 8: (07 17 2020) Wasn't able to work the last 2 days. Ready to build out a new streak. Working on building out a data viz based on the Roman Emperor data set from Tidy Tuesday. 

Day 9: Learned about geom_segments and combining with geom_labels. Looking at how to stop overlapping on the segments. 

[Day 10](https://github.com/BrettMoxham/Tidy-Tuesday/blob/master/07%2017%202020%20-%20Roman%20Emperors.rmd): Finished my visualiztion on the Roman Emperor data set from Tidy Tuesday. Utilized Plotly to make the data interactive. I think it worked out pretty well. <br>

Day 11: Worked on learning data cleaning. Case_when comes in handy here. Also learning the proper way to Google for answers to questions i may have. 

Day 12: Wasn't super motivated today. Was a long day at work. Still cracked open the laptop and gave it a go. Every day counts and having broken a streak before, i didn't want to do that again so soon.

Day 13: Worked on my viz from yesterday, but went off in an entirely different direction that i had originally planned. Also found the gghighlight package and experimented with that!

Day 14: Super informative and productive day. Learned lots about annoations. Hoping to have the current viz project finished in the next few days!

Day 16: Missed an update from day 15, sorry. Working on combining multiple plots into 1 visualization. Really close to having it all together. Focusing on the 80/20 rule, so its not perfect, but the bones are there!

[Day 17:](https://github.com/BrettMoxham/Tidy-Tuesday/blob/master/07%2020%202020%20-%20Rappers.Rmd) Finally built out my Rappers png. Learned a lot in terms of themes and displaying mutiple different plots. This project went way off from where i started but I'm glad it did. Is the png perfect? No, but following the 80/20 rule I'm very happy with it. <br>

Day 18: Began working on my contribution to this weeks Tidy Tuesday.

[Day 19](https://github.com/BrettMoxham/Tidy-Tuesday/blob/master/07%2027%202020%20-%20TT%20-%20Palmer%20Penguins.Rmd): Submitted my first contribution to Tidy Tuesday. Looked at bodymass vs flipper length in Palmer Station Penguins <br>

[Day 20:](https://github.com/BrettMoxham/100-Days-of-Code/blob/master/07%2009%202020%20-%20Joe%20Kelly.Rmd) Graphed Joe Kelly suspension from the MLB, and learned about annotations and how to insert an image into my plots. <br>
