# 100-Days-of-Code
Work for my 100 Days of Code Challenge
Started: July 8th 2020

Day 1: Started work on building out a race chart for cumulative HR from the Batters dataset from Sean Lahman. Code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/BrettMoxham/100-Days-of-Code/blob/master/07%2008%202020%20-%20HR%20Race.Rmd)

Day 2: Continued work on the race chart. Kept wracking my head trying to figure out why my basic graph wasn't annimating correctly. Realised that the players were not carried all the way through all potential years. Will have to adjust data set to fix this.
