# 100-Days-of-Code
Work for my 100 Days of Code Challenge
Started: July 8th 2020

Day 1: Started work on building out a race chart for cumulative HR from the Batters dataset from Sean Lahman. Code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/BrettMoxham/100-Days-of-Code/blob/master/07%2008%202020%20-%20HR%20Race.Rmd)

Day 2: Continued work on the race chart. Kept wracking my head trying to figure out why my basic graph wasn't annimating correctly. Realised that the players were not carried all the way through all potential years. Will have to adjust data set to fix this. 

Day 3: Worked on the player/yearID issue that had me stumped. Pretty sure i got it figured out. Learned a lot in terms of merging and joining. As well as dealing with NA's. Hoping to have the final graph out tomorrow!

Day 4: Spent more time on the building the gif. Failed miserably ![see here](https://github.com/BrettMoxham/100-Days-of-Code/blob/master/HR_total_failed.gif) Still going to power through! Going to attempt to follow the code from Jon Harmon - https://github.com/jonthegeek/tidytuesday/blob/master/jon/2019-36/code.R.

Day 5: Built out the final gif in the current project. Really happy with how it turned out. Learned a lot, ready to move on to the next project.

Day 6: Worked on building out a [custom theme](https://github.com/BrettMoxham/100-Days-of-Code/blob/master/07%2013%202020%20-%20Custom%20Theme.Rmd) for my plots moving forward. Going to look at building out a personal library so i have quick access to it. 

Day 7: Learned about developing a personal library. Put my custom theme in so I can use it going forward. Followed the tutorial from [Fong Chun Chan](https://tinyheero.github.io/jekyll/update/2015/07/26/making-your-first-R-package.html). Good first week! Ready for the next challenge.

Day 8: (07 17 2020) Wasn't able to work the last 2 days. Ready to build out a new streak. Working on building out a data viz based on the Roman Emperor data set from Tidy Tuesday. 

Day 9: Learned about geom_segments and combining with geom_labels. Looking at how to stop overlapping on the segments. 

Day 10: Finished my visualiztion on the Roman Emperor data set from Tidy Tuesday. Utilized Plotly to make the data interactive. I think it worked out pretty well. <br>
